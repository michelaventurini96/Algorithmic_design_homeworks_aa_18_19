# Algorithmic_design_homeworks_aa_18_19
The repoistory contains the solutions of the tasks assigned during the course.

## 01_Strassen
The folder contains the implementation of the Strassen algorithm with soome improvement in memory usage. 

## 02_Chain_Matrix_Multiplication
The folder contains the implementation of the the iterative dynamic-programming algorithm to solve the chain matrix multiplication problem. Morover some tests to derive the complexity of the algorithm have been carried out and the result is reported in the respective plot.
